                <p>This was easly one of the most fun, if not the most fun project for me this semester. Premier was easy to understand and I liked that I had a lot of creative freedom. I wanted to make a video that encapselated as much of earths nature as I could, but that made it a challenge because the video could not be longer than 2 minutes and I could only have 12 clip, meaning I would have to be selective. Despite this, I think the video turned out great and I would gladly to the assignment again!</p>
