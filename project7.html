                <p>Project Description:This animation assignment could not have come at a worse time, as I had a lot of other work to finish and was very busy.On top of that, I didnt really like how Adobe animate worked, and It took me a while to figure out how to do things correctly. Unfortunitly, I didnt much enjoy this assignment, but I do wish I could do it again just with the knowledge and time I have now to create a better animation.</p>
