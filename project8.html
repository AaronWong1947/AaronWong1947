                <p>Project Description:Doom,the first piece I ever made in photoshop is the culmination of figureing out how to use the tools and a lot of experimentation. Going into it, I had no real idea what I was going to create, but I wanted to learn and experiment with as many different techniques and tools I could. I was very happy with how it turned out and how much more comfortable I felt with Photoshop than before I made it. </p>
